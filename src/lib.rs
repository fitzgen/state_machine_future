Easily create type-safe `Future`s from state machines â€” without the boilerplate.

`state_machine_future` type checks state machines and their state transitions,
and then generates `Future` implementations and typestate<sup>[0][]</sup>
boilerplate for you.

## Introduction

Most of the time, using `Future` combinators like `map` and `then` are a great
way to describe an asynchronous computation. Other times, the most natural way
to describe the process at hand is a state machine.

When writing state machines in Rust, we want to *leverage the type system to
enforce that only valid state transitions may occur*. To do that, we want
*typestates*<sup>[0][]</sup>: types that represents each state in the state
machine, and methods whose signatures only permit valid state transitions. But
we *also* need an `enum` of every possible state, so we can treat the whole
state machine as a single entity, and implement `Future` for it. But this is
getting to be a *lot* of boilerplate...

Enter `#[derive(StateMachineFuture)]`.

With `#[derive(StateMachineFuture)]`, we describe the states and the possible
transitions between them, and then the custom derive generates:

* A typestate for each state in the state machine.

* A type for the whole state machine that implements `Future`.

* A concrete `start` method that constructs the state machine `Future` for you,
initialized to its start state.

* A state transition polling trait, with a `poll_zee_choo` method for each
non-final state `ZeeChoo`. This trait describes the state machine's valid
transitions, and its methods are called by `Future::poll`.

Then, all *we* need to do is implement the generated state transition polling
trait.

Additionally, `#[derive(StateMachineFuture)]` will statically prevent against
some footguns that can arise when writing state machines:

* Every state is reachable from the start state: *there are no useless states.*

* *There are no states which cannot reach a final state*. These states would
otherwise lead to infinite loops.

* *All state transitions are valid.* Attempting to make an invalid state
transition fails to type check, thanks to the generated typestates.

## Guide

Describe the state machine's states with an `enum` and add
`#[derive(StateMachineFuture)]` to it:

```ignore
#[derive(StateMachineFuture)]
enum MyStateMachine {
    // ...
}
```

There must be one **start** state, which is the initial state upon construction;
one **ready** state, which corresponds to `Future::Item`; and one **error**
state, which corresponds to `Future::Error`.

```ignore
#[derive(StateMachineFuture)]
enum MyStateMachine {
    #[state_machine_future(start)]
    Start,

    // ...

    #[state_machine_future(ready)]
    Ready(MyItem),

    #[state_machine_future(error)]
    Error(MyError),
}
```

Any other variants of the `enum` are intermediate states.

We define which state-to-state transitions are valid with
`#[state_machine_future(transitions(...))]`. This attribute annotates a state
variant, and lists which other states can be transitioned to immediately after
this state.

A final state (either **ready** or **error**) must be reachable from every
intermediate state and the **start** state. Final states are not allowed to have
transitions.

```ignore
#[derive(StateMachineFuture)]
enum MyStateMachine {
    #[state_machine_future(start, transitions(Intermediate))]
    Start,

    #[state_machine_future(transitions(Start, Ready))]
    Intermediate { x: usize, y: usize },

    #[state_machine_future(ready)]
    Ready(MyItem),

    #[state_machine_future(error)]
    Error(MyError),
}
```

From this state machine description, the custom derive generates boilerplate for
us.

For each state, the custom derive creates:

* A typestate for the state. The type's name matches the variant name, for
example the `Intermediate` state variant's typestate is also named `Intermediate`.
The kind of struct type generated matches the variant kind: a unit-style variant
results in a unit struct, a tuple-style variant results in a tuple struct, and a
struct-style variant results in a normal struct with fields.

| State `enum` Variant                              | Generated Typestate            |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `enum StateMachine { MyState, ... }`              | `struct MyState;`              |
| `enum StateMachine { MyState(bool, usize), ... }` | `struct MyState(bool, usize);` |
| `enum StateMachine { MyState { x: usize }, ... }` | `struct MyState { x: usize };` |

* An `enum` for the possible states that can come after this state. This `enum`
is named `AfterX` where `X` is the state's name. There is also a `From<Y>`
implementation for each `Y` state that can be transitioned to after `X`. For
example, the `Intermediate` state would get:

```ignore
enum AfterIntermediate {
    Start(Start),
    Ready(Ready),
}

impl From<Start> for AfterIntermediate {
    // ...
}

impl From<Ready> for AfterIntermediate {
    // ...
}
```

Next, for the state machine as a whole, the custom derive generates:

* A state machine `Future` type, which is essentially an `enum` of all the
different typestates. This type is named `BlahFuture` where `Blah` is the name
of the state machine description `enum`. In this example, where the state
machine description is named `MyStateMachine`, the generated state machine
future type would be named `MyStateMachineFuture`.

* A polling trait, `PollBordle` where `Bordle` is this state machine
description's name. For each non-final state `TootWasabi`, this trait has a
method, `poll_toot_wasabi`, which is like `Future::poll` but specialized to the
current state. Each method takes conditional ownership of its state (via
[`RentToOwn`][rent_to_own]) and returns a `futures::Poll<AfterThisState, Error>`
where `Error` is the state machine's error type. This signature *does not allow
invalid state transitions*, which makes attempting an illegal state transition
fail to type check. Here is the `MyStateMachine`'s polling trait, for example:

```ignore
trait PollMyStateMachine {
    fn poll_start<'a>(
        start: &'a mut RentToOwn<'a, Start>,
    ) -> Poll<AfterStart, Error>;

    fn poll_intermediate<'a>(
        intermediate: &'a mut RentToOwn<'a, Intermediate>,
    ) -> Poll<AfterIntermediate, Error>;
}
```

* An implementation of `Future` for that type. This implementation dispatches to
the appropriate polling trait method depending on what state the future is
in:

  * If the `Future` is in the `Start` state, then it uses `<MyStateMachine as
    PollMyStateMachine>::poll_start`.

  * If it is in the `Intermediate` state, then it uses `<MyStateMachine as
    PollMyStateMachine>::poll_intermediate`.

  * Etc...

* A concrete `start` method for the description type (so `MyStateMachine::start`
in this example) which constructs a new state machine `Future` type in its
**start** state for you. This method has a parameter for each field in the
**start** state variant.

| Start `enum` Variant            | Generated `start` Method                                            |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `MyStart,`                      | `fn start() -> MyStateMachineFuture { ... }`                        |
| `MyStart(bool, usize),`         | `fn start(arg0: bool, arg1: usize) -> MyStateMachineFuture { ... }` |
| `MyStart { x: char, y: bool },` | `fn start(x: char, y: bool) -> MyStateMachineFuture { ... }`        |

Given all those generated types and traits, all we have to do is `impl PollBlah
for Blah` for our state machine `Blah`.

```ignore
impl PollMyStateMachine for MyStateMachine {
    fn poll_start<'a>(
        start: &'a mut RentToOwn<'a, Start>
    ) -> Poll<AfterStart, MyError> {
        // Call `try_ready!(start.inner.poll())` with any inner futures here.
        //
        // If we're ready to transition states, then we should return
        // `Ok(Async::Ready(AfterStart))`. If we are not ready to transition
        // states, return `Ok(Async::NotReady)`. If we encounter an error,
        // return `Err(...)`.
    }

    fn poll_intermediate<'a>(
        intermediate: &'a mut RentToOwn<'a, Intermediate>
    ) -> Poll<AfterIntermediate, MyError> {
        // Same deal as above...
    }
}
```

## Context

The state machine also allows to pass in a context that is available in every `poll_*` method
without having to explicitly include it in every one.

The context can be specified through the `context` argument of the `state_machine_future` attribute.
This will add parameters to the `start` method as well as to each `poll_*` method of the trait.
Note that if the context has type parameters, those type parameters must be declared in the
context argument, along with any associated bounds.

```
#[macro_use]
extern crate state_machine_future;
extern crate futures;

use futures::*;
use state_machine_future::*;

struct MyContext<T> where T: Clone {
    data: T,
}

struct MyItem {

}

enum MyError {

}

#[derive(StateMachineFuture)]
#[state_machine_future(context = "MyContext<T: Clone>")]
enum MyStateMachine {
    #[state_machine_future(start, transitions(Intermediate))]
    Start,

    #[state_machine_future(transitions(Start, Ready))]
    Intermediate { x: usize, y: usize },

    #[state_machine_future(ready)]
    Ready(MyItem),

    #[state_machine_future(error)]
    Error(MyError),
}

impl PollMyStateMachine for MyStateMachine {
    fn poll_start<'s, 'c, T: Clone>(
        start: &'s mut RentToOwn<'s, Start>,
        context: &'c mut RentToOwn<'c, MyContext<T>>
    ) -> Poll<AfterStart, MyError> {

        // The `context` instance passed into `start` is available here.
        // It is a mutable reference, so are free to modify it.

        unimplemented!()
    }

    fn poll_intermediate<'s, 'c, T: Clone>(
        intermediate: &'s mut RentToOwn<'s, Intermediate>,
        context: &'c mut RentToOwn<'c, MyContext<T>>
    ) -> Poll<AfterIntermediate, MyError> {

        // The `context` is available here as well.
        // It is the same instance. This means if `poll_start` modified it, those
        // changes will be visible to this method as well.

        unimplemented!()
    }
}

fn main() {
    let _ = MyStateMachine::start(MyContext {
        data: "foo",
    });
}
```

Same as for the state argument, the context can be taken through the `RentToOwn` type!
However, be aware that once you take the context, the state machine will **always** return
`Async::NotReady` **without** invoking the `poll_` methods anymore. The one exception to
this is when the state machine is in a ready or error state, where it will resolve normally
when polled if the context has been taken.

That's it!

## Attributes

This is a list of all of the attributes used by `state_machine_future`:

* `#[derive(StateMachineFuture)]`: Placed on an `enum` that describes a state
machine.

* `#[state_machine_future(derive(Clone, Debug, ...))]`: Placed on the `enum`
that describes the state machine. This attribute describes which
`#[derive(...)]`s to place on the generated `Future` type.

* `#[state_machine_future(start)]`: Used on a variant of the state machine
description `enum`. There must be exactly one variant with this attribute. This
describes the initial starting state. The generated `start` method has a
parameter for each field in this variant.

* `#[state_machine_future(ready)]`: Used on a variant of the state machine
description `enum`. There must be exactly one variant with this attribute. It
must be a tuple-style variant with one field, for example `Ready(MyItemType)`.
The generated `Future` implementation uses the field's type as `Future::Item`.

* `#[state_machine_future(error)]`: Used on a variant of the state machine
description `enum`. There must be exactly one variant with this attribute. It
must be a tuple-style variant with one field, for example `Error(MyError)`.  The
generated `Future` implementation uses the field's type as `Future::Error`.

* `#[state_machine_future(transitions(OtherState, AnotherState, ...))]`: Used on
a variant of the state machine description `enum`. Describes the states that
this one can transition to.

## Macro

An auxiliary macro is provided that helps reducing boilerplate code for state
transitions. So, the following code:

```Ok(Ready(NextState(1).into()))```

Can be reduced to:

```transition!(NextState(1))```

## Features

Here are the `cargo` features that you can enable:

* `debug_code_generation`: Prints the code generated by
`#[derive(StateMachineFuture)]` to `stdout` for debugging purposes.
